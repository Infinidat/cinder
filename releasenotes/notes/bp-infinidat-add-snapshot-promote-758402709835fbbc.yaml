    Infinidat driver: Added support for snapshot promote feature.
    The snapshot promotion feature, now available for the Infinidat
    storage software, provides a very efficient method for creating
    independent volumes from existing snapshots or volumes with
    minimal overhead (no data copying required, resulting in lower
    resource consumption and faster performance).
